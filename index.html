               My name is Carol Tang.
            </p>
            <p>
               I'm a QA Engineer, unofficially known as bug hunter and customer advocate.
            </p>
            <p>
               I'm all about details, quality, and learning, but I keep in mind the big picture as well.

            <p>
               I graduated August 2017 with a B.A. in linguistics from UC Berkeley and some experience 
               in programming, courtesy of the time when I was an intended computer science major. In my free time I like 
               to paint digitally, learn languages, play jigsaw puzzles, and improve my web dev skills.
            </p>
            <p>
               <strong>Currently:</strong> learning how to poll asynchronous web apps for automated testing results, upping coding skills, and refreshing CS knowledge.

                     <p>I was mostly a manual tester, but I did do some automation with Selenium and Python in Pycharm. At HydroPoint I:</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Designed and implemented black box, sanity, smoke, and regression test strategies,</li>
                        <li>Developed deep expertise in company products (3 web applications and multiple firmware versions),</li>
                        <li>Documented test cases with the TestRail test case management application,</li>
                        <li>Thoroughly explained and documented defects via the Jira issue tracking system,</li>
                        <li>Performed pre-release preparations and post-release sanity testing,</li>
                        <li>Collaborated with the broader engineering team to identify, understand, and resolve the root causes of defects and customer escalations, and </li>
                        <li>Configured and maintained up to 4 test environments.</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>
                        During the second half of my time at HydroPoint, I found that I was having a hard time prioritizing 
                        my tasks and figuring out how to relate to my boss, and I upset a coworker due to this. However, I 
                        learned a lot, like that my manager isn't going to roll their eyes at me because I asked what 
                        they want me to finish first, and that if I'm having trouble with getting things done, I can ask my manager 
                        for tips and let him know I'm struggling. This lesson is something I want to keep in mind at my next job.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Additionally, automated testing at HydroPoint was rather difficult for me, and I learned (after a lot of Googling)
                        that it was all due to asychronous data and not my code. I didn't get very far on learning to how 
                        poll a site for results, but I plan on doing so before May comes.

                     <p>I was a core member of the organization's startup team. Between academics and club activities I:</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Standardized brand guidelines to unify design,</li>
                        <li>Redesigned the Our Team page to improve UX/UI and maintain visitors’ attention,</li>
                        <li>Designed and hand-coded the What’s New and Feature boxes on home page to increase user engagement and transparency about the latest news from the organization,</li>
                        <li>Inspected site design regularly to minimize discrepancies, and</li>
                        <li>Updated the blog to keep partners and supporters updated on the organization.</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>
                        Not only did I keep the organization's website up-to-date with current web design trends and standards, the new designs garnered praise from site visitors and increased interest from potential partners and supporters. It also gave me room to challenge myself. In half a summer, I learned how to code in jQuery, design and develop using UX and UI concepts, create traditional wireframes, code mockups, use browser developer tools, debug browser-specific problems, and work with people from all over the organization (and outside of it). This was all kind of terrifying, but I'm so glad I did it.
